			  "title": "Deploying Node Apps to Servers You Already Have With Stagecoach"
			, "description": "Not every Node app belongs in the cloud. The performance wins of Node can be biggest for those who bring their own servers to the party, and intranet apps often must be internally hosted. Stagecoach is a simple toolkit for painlessly deploying and hosting Node apps on Linux, especially Ubuntu Linux. The talk will cover installation of node and MongoDB from a sysadmin's perspective, deployment of Node apps with sc-deploy and hosting of multiple Node apps on the same server with sc-proxy. The stagecoach project lives here: https://github.com/punkave/stagecoach"

			  "title": "Your Module Doesn't Exist Without Tests"
			, "description": "Unit testing is not a new thing. There are a surprising number of modules in NPM that have zero test coverage. Writing tests gives you and others confidence in your code, makes it easier to maintain and easier for others to contribute. There are plenty of unit test frameworks available, but today's talk will take a look at Jasime and how we can integrate this into our development cycle. Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework that has no external JS dependencies. The framework lives at https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine"
